# Meal Catalogue App
This is a single-page application (SPA) built with react and redux. The main function of this application is to display a catalog of different meals that can be served in any restaurant. It allows customers to see details of each meal and to make a decision whether to buy or not. The application pulls the information about the meals from The mealDB API. The list of meals on display can be filtered using the meal origin area (country of origin of the meal). Detailed information about each meal can be seen by clicking on the See Details button below each meal. This will display further information about each meal including name, origin area, basic ingredients, and instruction on how to prepare the meal. You can also view information about this restaurant by clicking on the About Us tab on the navigation bar. You can go back to the home page by clicking the Home tab or the name of the application. This application is fully responsive.

## Main Features
- User Can list meals from different countries
